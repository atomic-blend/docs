# Cloud Provider

We use AWS as the main Cloud Provider for our SaaS infrastructure.

The choice of AWS made sense for a lot of points, especially with a SaaS that (I hope) will need high scalability and availability :&#x20;

* Stability
* Speed
* Loads of tools
* Managed services that allow scaling
* Storage provider, cert-manager...



Since all the data that matters is end-to-end encrypted, and stored in Europe, it makes sense to use AWS for what they really are : a great cloud provider.
